# Week 8 Form Validation
if else makes sense
the condition is true run one set of code
otherwise in else
run a different set of code.

to clear the error message
set ERR.textContent = ""

and call the calculateMPGAndTripCostAvg in the else code
also modified calculateMPGAndTripCostAvg to call updateAVG
