# week 13 - Implement Class into mileage

## my attempt
I created a new class called Data
and called new Data(miles, gallons, price)
from the trackMPGAndCost function,
it works.

## what broke and how can we fix it.
Nothing broke for me, I just didn't prefix the 
property with _, and everything works.
