# week 10 creating table with code

I like arrow functions.
not sure about clean
if follow the styleguide is what I should do, I don't prefer one style over the other


## where in code do we start to render the table
inside trackMPGAndCost function


## how you think we would render the input data into the table.
same way we rendered the table header
loop through MY_DATA and create rows with corresponding values
