# week 10 creating table with code

I like arrow functions.
not sure about clean
if follow the styleguide is what I should do, I don't prefer one style over the other


## where in code do we start to render the table
inside trackMPGAndCost function


## how you think we would render the input data into the table.
same way we rendered the table header
loop through MY_DATA and create rows with corresponding values

## how to fix order issue
not sure, this is confusing, I don't have this issue

### saw the solution
ah, solution makes sense, order is based on how it got created

## how can we fix the Rendering table issues at the end of first assignment in week 10
hmm, delete all html inside div#table-output  and recreate, just like how err message gets cleared everytime

## final
understood the code
