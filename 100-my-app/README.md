## Render Plan
I want to output like a list

inputs will be in the first line as h5
and output will be in the next line as h2
edit and delete button will be below the output

# Week #14
The rendering was already working, just added a bit of css
I want to show the inputs, because the user of this app likes to 
all the data, that got used for a decision
